## Technical Requirements

You can choose between:

1) A DOM manipulation project. If you choose this approach, the webpage must:

    Have a minimum of 2 HTML pages.
    Have content and styles.
    Include separate HTML and CSS files.
    You can choose any topic you like (movies, shows, a portfolio, a series of books, etc.).
    Your webpage must include three different interactions using DOM manipulation with three different event listeners. For instance: a button that allows the user to write their name in a prompt and then prints it on the webpage as a way of personalization, buttons to make elements show and hide, buttons to make color or image changes, etc.
    Nice to have: responsive behavior.

2) A game project. This approach also uses DOM manipulation but includes heavier logic implementation and more programming. If you choose this approach, the webpage must:

    Have minimum one HTML page.
    Show instructions for the user.
    Include a very simple game, like the one you coded last week (Guess what number I am thinking).
    Allow the user to perform some interaction, like clicks or input filling, that results in losing or winning. For instance, you could program a game like Wordle, a Memory Game, a quick-click game, etc.
    Include the use of at least one setInterval or setTimeout, even if it is to show an alert.
